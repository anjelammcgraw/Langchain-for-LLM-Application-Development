# 🤖 Langchain for LLM Application Development

In this repo, we'll be working through expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development using the LangChain framework. We'll use LLMS for various use cases: Prompts, Parsers, Memories, Chains, Q&A for data, & Agents

# ⚙️The Build Process (Deliverables)

### Build 🏗️

* **Models, Prompts and Parsers:** calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
* **Memories for LLMs:** memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
* **Chains:** creating sequences of operations
* **Question Answering over Documents:** apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
* **Agents**
